## **Introduction**
Ever since I started using [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/), it’s completely changed how I deal with information. I’ll admit it — I’m a bit lazy when it comes to digging through dense resources. Got a research paper? I’ll let two AI bots debate it. Found an intriguing book? I just upload the PDF and chat with it. Two-hour podcast on YouTube? I’ll skim through an AI-generated summary and move on.

NotebookLM is this incredibly useful AI research and note-taking assistant that reshapes how you engage with content. It lets you sift through massive amounts of material, ask questions grounded in your own sources, and even discover insights you might have missed.

## **Problem**

But there’s one snag: NotebookLM only accepts individual YouTube video URLs. You can’t just throw in an entire playlist — which becomes a real limitation when you're working with full-length courses, lecture series, or curated educational content.

## **Solution**

That’s where this automation comes in. I built a simple Python script to bridge that gap — by turning any YouTube playlist into a single, clean text file that’s ready for NotebookLM or any AI tool you prefer.

## **Tools Used**
To make this automation both efficient and reliable, I leaned on a few powerful tools and libraries that handle the heavy lifting:

1. [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
This is a command-line tool (and an actively maintained fork of youtube-dl) that lets you extract metadata from YouTube videos and playlists — including video IDs, titles, and more — without downloading the actual videos. It’s fast, script-friendly, and perfect for extracting structured info at scale.

2. [youtube-transcript-api](https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api "youtube-transcript-api")
This Python library makes it easy to fetch transcripts from YouTube videos, whether they’re human-generated or auto-generated by YouTube. It also supports fallback options and handles cases where transcripts are partially available or in different languages.

3. pandas
For collecting, organizing, and optionally analyzing the transcript data, pandas is a no-brainer. It helps structure everything into a clean DataFrame before exporting it to a .txt file.

4. Standard Python Libraries
Modules like subprocess, json, and re are used to interact with command-line tools, parse metadata, and clean up the transcript text by removing things like [Music], [Laughter], etc.

These tools work together seamlessly, giving you a script that’s both robust and easy to modify if you want to extend its functionality later.

## **The Code**
The codes automates the extraction of transcripts from an entire YouTube playlist. It works by first using yt-dlp to gather all video URLs from the playlist. Then, for each video, it fetches the transcript using youtube-transcript-api, cleans it by removing unwanted annotations, and saves the final output as a single text file — organized by video title

### Step 1: Import Required Libraries

{% highlight python linenos %}
import subprocess, json, re
import pandas as pd
from youtube_transcript_api import (
    YouTubeTranscriptApi, TranscriptsDisabled,
    NoTranscriptFound, VideoUnavailable
)
{% endhighlight %}

What we're doing here:

* subprocess: to run yt-dlp commands.
* json and re: to parse and clean data.
* pandas: to structure and export results.
* youtube_transcript_api: to fetch transcripts directly from YouTube.

### Step 2: Extract All Video URLs from the Playlist

{% highlight python linenos %}
# Fetch all video URLs from a YouTube playlist
def get_playlist_urls(playlist_url):
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(
            ['yt-dlp', '--flat-playlist', '--dump-json', playlist_url],
            capture_output=True, text=True, check=True
        )
        return [
            f"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={json.loads(line)['id']}"
            for line in result.stdout.strip().split('\n')
        ]
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print("yt-dlp error:", e)
        return []
{% endhighlight %}

Using yt-dlp, this function pulls only the video IDs from a playlist. We then reconstruct the full video URLs for each item. It’s efficient, fast, and doesn’t download any actual video content.
