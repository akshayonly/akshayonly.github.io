Biological sequences, the strings of letters like AGTACACTGGT, are the cornerstone of bioinformatics. They're the most basic form of representing biological entities like DNA, RNA, and proteins. In Biopython, these sequences are handled through a fundamental concept known as the Seq object. 

# Seq Object: Beyond Basic Strings
At first glance, sequences in bioinformatics look like simple strings of letters. This representation aligns with how sequences are presented in most biological file formats. However, Biopython's Seq object offers much more than what meets the eye.

Key Differences from Python Strings
The Seq object in Biopython, while similar to Python strings in many ways, boasts unique features tailored for biological data. The critical distinction lies in the methods the Seq object provides:

Biological Translation: Unlike standard Python strings, the Seq object has a translate() method that performs biological translation, converting a DNA or RNA sequence into its corresponding protein sequence.

Biologically Relevant Methods: The Seq object includes methods like reverse_complement(), crucial for tasks like finding the complementary strand of a DNA sequence.

Sequences as Strings: Practical Interactions
Despite these specialized capabilities, interacting with Seq objects is largely intuitive, mirroring interactions with standard Python strings. Here's a practical demonstration:

{% highlight python linenos  %}
from Bio.Seq import Seq
my_seq = Seq("GATCG")

# Iterating over the sequence
for index, letter in enumerate(my_seq):
    print("%i %s" % (index, letter))

# Output:
# 0 G
# 1 A
# 2 T
# 3 C
# 4 G

# Determining the length of the sequence
print(len(my_seq))  # Output: 5
{% endhighlight %}
